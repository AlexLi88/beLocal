Grocery Bot - Cheap groceries for the lazy.

Use Case:

Riz needs groceries. For cheap. He doesn't care much about the brands. Riz is also lazy. So he doesn't want to go to five different places to shop for deals.

Grocery Bot is the perfect solution for Riz.

Use Case 1

1. Riz launches the app.

2. He taps on "New Grocery List" button

3. He taps on "Add Item" button

4. He starts typing "Pape" and the auto suggest feature suggests "Paper Towels", "Paper Sheets", etc.

5. He selects "Paper Towels" and the item is added to the list.

6. Riz repeats this process for a few more items.

7. Riz then taps "Shop" button which promptly gives him the following list of local stores sorted by the total amount it would cost him to buy the items:

Walmart - 55.00
Thrifty’s - 62.00
Fairway - 68.00

8. Riz taps on one of the stores which promptly displays the list of items, along with the brand and prices which are available at that store:

Paper Towels - Bounty - $15.00
Garbage Bags - Glad - $25.00
...

More use cases to follow with regards to being able to specify what size, amount, brand of an item you want.  For example, “garbage bags” is very general.
