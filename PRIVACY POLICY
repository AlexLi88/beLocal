At beLocal, our privacy policy is simple. In order to provide farmers and foodmakers with a partially completed profile (including email address and Facebook profile picture) upon new registration, we require them to allow basic permissions for Facebook. One of the features we got asked about often during requirements gathering was the ability to post daily status updates directly from our app. As a result, when you first register as a farmer or foodmaker, beLocal will ask you to also approve the ability for it to post to Facebook on your behalf. 

It is imperitive to note that beLocal will never post to any of your social media accounts without first showing you exactly what will be posted, and asking for your express permission to post. If you would feel more comfortable managing posts manually, you may opt out of Facebook posting permissions and copy and paste the status message beLocal generates for you automatically into your own Facebook status update.

Finally, beLocal will never redistribute any of your personal information for any reason.
